# UAV Autonomy Workflow (ROS Noetic + PX4)

**Keywords**: ROS Noetic, Gazebo, PX4, MAVROS, QGroundControl, Offboard Mode, Keyboard Teleoperation, Simulation, Real Flight

This project aims to **replicate and extend** the workflow of controlling a PX4 UAV in Gazebo using keyboard teleoperation, followed by real-world manual flight tests and parameter logging â€” laying the groundwork for future **autonomous flight** and **machine learning / reinforcement learning** applications.

> ðŸ“Œ This repository contains: complete installation steps, simulation & real-flight workflows, experiment templates, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## 1. Introduction

The project investigates and evaluates UAV autonomous flight performance.  
Using both a virtual UAV simulation environment and real UAV hardware, the workflow starts with **Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic + Gazebo + PX4** setup, then integrates MAVROS for communication and control.  
Manual flight is first tested in simulation (keyboard control), then replicated in real hardware.

## 2. Literature Review

Several studies demonstrate that integrating advanced sensors with complex ML algorithms can greatly enhance UAV autonomy. Key technologies include:
- Navigation and positioning systems
- Autonomous decision-making algorithms
- Sensor data fusion

For example:
- Smith et al. (2021) explored GPS + vision-based dual-modality positioning.
- Jones et al. (2022) studied deep learningâ€“based obstacle avoidance strategies.

## 3. Methods

A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining theoretical study and practical implementation:
1. **Simulation Setup**  
   - OS: Ubuntu 20.04  
   - Installed ROS Noetic & Gazebo  
   - Configured PX4 SITL with MAVROS
2. **Hardware Setup**  
   - Selected compatible sensors & FCU for stable and safe flight  
   - Integrated logging & telemetry systems
3. **Data Collection**  
   - Log files and live telemetry
4. **Analysis**  
   - Flight performance metrics
   - Behavioural analysis under test scenarios
